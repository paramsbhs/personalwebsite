                                <p>I programmed a discord bot for my friends guild as he needed a solution to manage his server by letting users choose their own roles and do miscellaneous tasks. It also used the OpenAI API, using the text version of the model "davinci-003". I had no experience of JavaScript prior to this project. See more on my GitHub page.</p>

                                <p>As a Capstone Project for my highschool graduation, I created a solar panel phone charger using an UNO R3 Arduino board. I conducted research and figured out the fastest potential charging it could hold, which came out to be 5 watts. Using Blender, I created a 3D model of this device as a prototype.</p>

                                <h3>VEX Robot | ENGR 120 project</h3>
                                <div class="year">01/2023 - 04/2023</div>
                                <p>For my ENGR 120 class, we had to create a robot with basic functionality using a VEX robotics kit. I was the programmer and the secretary of the team. As a programmer, my job was to find the most efficient way to complete the task. The robot was programmed in ROBOTC, so I had to learn a bit of that language when we began. The solution of the problem never came to me for a long time, It took many tries to find the best algorithm but I eventually figured it out. It consisted of a simple nested for-loop to let the robot scan the area using its infrared detector and find the object. I also created a similar robot in robotics club, but using a newer VEX IQ kit. Unfortunately, I am unable to show you this project explicitly. I am however happy to talk more about it.</p>
