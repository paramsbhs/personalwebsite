            <h1>My Story</h1>
            <p>I was born in the Philippines and moved around multiple countries and ended up in Canada, I chose the University of Victoria as I was interested in the Software Engineering program. I began to have a passion in coding when I was 15 years old. It mainly started when I had a interest in computers as I started playing videogames at a very young age. I have been involved in technology for a while but it struck to me that programming would be the way to go. I aspire to develop programs to help other people.</p>
